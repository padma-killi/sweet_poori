*********************************How to make Sweet Poori Recipe at Home*********************************
*********************************Preparation of Flower Sweet Puri recipe*********************************
Here I’m using 1 cup of Wheat Flour and 1 cup of All Purpose Flour.
Usually only All Purpose Flour is used, but it is not Healthy. So I’m using Wheat flour also.
If only Wheat flour is used, Sweet Poori is might become Harder.
So we are using both Wheat Flour and All Purpose Flour.
Take 1 cup of Wheat Flour and 1 cup of All Purpose Flour in a bowl.
Add a pinch of salt and pinch of Baking soda.
Now add 2 teaspoons of oil and mix it well.
Then add water and knead it into a dough mix and close lid.
Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
Spread oil on palms and take a small amount of dough.
Now we need to divide the dough into 3 parts.
Three parts are; small, medium size & another is big in size.
Here we will be making 3 different sized Poori’s.
Now, we will roll each part into a soft ball and press it into a Puri.
Lets press the big puri first.
Roll the big part in dry flour and press it into a puri.
Don’t make the puri’s too thick.
Then press the medium sized puri followed by the small puri.
Now Place the puri one over the other.
Spread a little water on the bottom puri and stick the other puri over it.
Next, flip all the puri’s onto your middle finger and press them lightly.
Now flip them back again and press.
It’s shown like a Ganneru puvvu.
